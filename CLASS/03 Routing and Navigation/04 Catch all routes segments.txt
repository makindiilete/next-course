As our route parameters grows, it might become more difficult to catch these parameters by creating nested folders.
There is a better way.

You can catch as many segments as possible using the syntax : [...slug]
NOTE: Atleast a parameter must be passed for this to work else the page will land on 404 error page...
To make parameters optional, you should use the syntax : [[...slug]]


import React from "react";
interface IProps {
  params: { slug: string[] };
}
const ProductDetails = ({ params: { slug } }: IProps) => {
  return <div>{`Product routes ==> ${slug}`}</div>;
};

export default ProductDetails;
