React is a library but NextJs is a complete framework built ontop of react which enables us build
fast an search engine friendly application. Just like Angular and Vue, it comes with its own CLI, Router etc but more than
Angular and Vue, it comes with Compiler and NodeJs runtime... With the NodeJS runtime we can write both
frontend and backend code with the same Next framework.. D frontend code will be executed with Web browser
and the backend code will be executed with NodeJs runtime.

With NextJs, we have server side rendering and static site generation.
