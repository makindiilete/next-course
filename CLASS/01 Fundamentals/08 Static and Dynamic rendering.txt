STATIC RENDERING: - NextJs will load this pages at build time and cache them, when next we load the pages, NextJs
fetch the pages and render them from cache. Mostly useful for pages without dynamic content. D content always d same.

DYNAMIC RENDERING : - A request is made to the server each time a page is rendered.

We can see how static vs Dynamic rendering work in real time by making use of Date.now() function.

-     <p>{new Date().toLocaleString()}</p> : - With this we can see the current date and time and refresh to see if it
gets updated then it is dynamic, else if it rendered once and never update then it is static.

NOTE:- U need to create a production build with 'npm run build' to see this in action
