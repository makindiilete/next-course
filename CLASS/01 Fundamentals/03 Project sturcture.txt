-   The 'app' folder : - This is the AppRouter and the container for our routing system.. Unlike normal
react, we do not need to create routes separately, each file created is a route on it own.

-   The 'public' folder : - This is where we keep our assets, fonts etc

-   The 'global.css' file is like the App.css of react where our general css lives
