IMAGE : - import Image from "next/image";

NextJs comes with an Image component which is preferrable to be used in NextJs app over the normal html img tag.
-   It compresses image
-   It resize the image based on device size

WORKING WITH LOCALLY STORED IMAGES
-   Create an 'images' folder inside the public folder
-   Save an image in the images folder

import coffee from "@/public/images/coffee.jpg";
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Image src={coffee} alt="coffee" />
    </main>
  );
}


WORKING WITH REMOTE IMAGES

To protect your application from malicious users, configuration is required in order to use external images.
 This ensures that only external images from your account can be served from the Next.js Image Optimization API.
 These external images can be configured with the remotePatterns property in your next.config.js file, as shown below:
https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#remotepatterns

NOTE: - U always need to specify a width and height for remote images

PROPS

fill :- A boolean that causes the image to fill the parent element, which is useful when the width and height
 are unknown.

sizes : - A string, similar to a media query, that provides information about how wide the image will be at different
 breakpoints. The value of sizes will greatly affect performance for images using fill or which are styled
  to have a responsive size.

import coffee from "@/public/images/coffee.jpg";
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Image
        src="https://advancly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/advancly_advest_investor.png"
        alt="Advancly"
        // width={300}
        // height={170}
        fill
        sizes="100vw"
        objectFit="contain"
        quality={100}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
